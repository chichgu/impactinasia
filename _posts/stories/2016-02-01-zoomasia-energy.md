With 100% renewable electricity, 70% renewable heating and 100% carbon neutral transportation, [Samso](http://www.go100percent.org/cms/index.php?id=70&tx_ttnews[tt_news]=30) in Denmark is probably the city closest to achieving a fully sustainable energy system. Most cities around the world, however,  are very far from the UN “Affordable and clean energy” goal. Asia is no exception. 

<h3>The challenge of accelerating demand</h3>

Only ¼ of Asians enjoy modern energy supply, with almost 20% living without electricity, and 54% still relying on “traditional” solid fuels for cooking. But burning wood, dung or charcoal to fuel open fires or basic indoor stoves emits a highly hazardous cocktail of air pollutants and small particles. Not to mention the tremendous time lost to collecting fuel, especially for the women who spend about 7 times as many hours on fuel collection as men. Consequently, the poor pay around eight times more for the same unit of energy as others, due to direct and indirect costs. 

But Asia’s growth is skyrocketing: in 2050, the region is expected to account for more than 50% of the GDP, and around 60% of the world’s population. This means more people, each of them consuming more energy to satisfy their increasing living standards. Therefore, Asia’s share of the global energy consumption could rise from 34% in 2010 to more than 51-56% in 2035.

<h3>A long road to clean and affordable energy for everyone</h3>

The problem is, the current composition of Asia’s energy mix and the level of investment in the sector are structurally insufficient to meet this demand. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that the pace of investment must be multiplied by 5 to reach the $1 trillion needed for universal access to energy and electricity by 2030. Even if this amount were to be invested, Asia would still face a shortage of fossil fuels. Although the region has huge quantities of coal available, it only has 15% of the world’s technically recoverable oil and natural gas.

Then, why not invest massively in coal? It would be a good idea if it were not the very first greenhouse gas (GHG) emitter, with ⅓ of the global CO2 production. Quite unexpectedly, [Vietnam recently announced it will call off all its future coal projects](https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/vietnam-throws-out-coal-plans-commits-to-renewable/), optimize the existing ones and invest in renewables. Nevertheless, Asia’s current energy mix is very far from being sustainable, and forecasts are not very promising. Without any change of policy, Asia’s consumption of oil would double, gas triple, and coal use see a 82% increase by 2035, doubling CO2 emissions.

<h3>Any solutions?</h3>

One essential step is to radically exchange fossil fuel sources of energy for sustainable ones: wind, sea and river’s flow, sun, heat, differentials of temperature, geothermal energy, biogas, biomass, or even human physical effort. For example, the wind potential of Asia is gigantic: Mongolia and China could install enough to produce 60% of China’s electricity consumption (5 terawatts, i.e. 5 million megawatts).

Innovations in the sector are flourishing and getting cheaper. [Billions in Change](http://billionsinchange.com/) invented an indoor bicycle able to produce 24h of electricity for an hour of effort. Manure can produce gas for cooking, seaweed can replace oil as a fuel, solar panel efficiency is being improved… Even the deleterious current cooking fuels are being [replaced by safe and local resources](http://www.ted.com/talks/amy_smith_shares_simple_lifesaving_design). 

Even with clean energy, a crucial point is nevertheless to reduce our needs for energy by lowering our individual consumption and optimize energy demand from urban planning, buildings, vehicles, networks etc. One of the main challenges of green building is to use less energy for the same result (heating, cooling, lightning…) through alternative building materials or innovative architecture. 

Alternatives exist and need to be monitored and customized in each country according to its features. In March 2015, [Asia’s Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All) Hub](http://www.se4all.org/hubs_asia-pacific-hub) was launched for that exact purpose.
