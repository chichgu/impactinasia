As the outcome of a long and painful [protest for a minimum wage increase](http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-01-09/cambodians-risk-their-lives-for-160-a-month), Cambodian garment workers finally won a [rise of 28%](http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/cambodian-garment-workers-get-128-a-month-minimum-wage-1.2832510), i.e. at least 128$ per month, which is still not enough to live. Contrary to the overwhelming majority of fashion brands, still pushing for less labor cost, [Kambodja Giving Brand](http://www.kambodja-givingbrand.com/) is all about providing fair job opportunities with proper income and decent work conditions to the most vulnerable ones.

<h3>A quest for meaning</h3> 

Originally from Cambodia, Linda Quach grew up and studied marketing in France. She started her career as a consultant in the telecom industry, and it was not until she went to Hong Kong eight years ago that she entered fashion. 

First, her position in a bags and accessories trading company sparked her interest in the field. Slowly growing the dream to create her own label, she started to study the market, but the intense competition she discovered made her change her mind. 

She then went back to the consultancy industry to follow the career she studied for, but realised with time that she wanted to dedicate her energy to something meaningful. She first considered volunteering for an NGO in Cambodia, but she sought for long-term life choice. Her old dreams of creating a label were not very far and that is how she dove in.

<h3>When fashion becomes social</h3>

As she puts it “the social aspect gave me the courage to create a brand and the brand gave me the means to develop a social project”. She got trained on fashion design in a small Hong Kong school, after which she explored several NGOs in Cambodia.

Two organizations supporting poor children and their mothers were selected for a partnership. She spent almost a month with the women to train them on how to handcraft modern quality products made of leather, and combined with Khmer traditional fabric. 

She is now selling her first collection in Phnom Penh and Hong Kong where she is based, a new line is coming soon. She wishes in the future to reach the rest of the world and keep on raising awareness.
 
<h3>Three ways of giving back</h3>

All things considered, KAMBODJA Giving brand is actually “giving back” in three ways. First, it gives back to the country a sober, modern and exotic brand to be proud of, a showcase of what “made in Cambodia” can also mean.

Second, by working with NGOs exclusively, the company not only empowers women in difficult situations by providing them fair job opportunities, valuable skills and hopefully sense of achievement and pride, but also supports and contributes in providing fair income, proper work conditions and health insurance - the enterprise is very transparent about this. 

Finally, a percentage of the sales profits are donated to Passerelles Numériques Cambodia, a charity providing underprivileged children with an IT education.

<h3>Purpose driven sustainability </h3>

When you ask Linda if the company is a social enterprise, the answer is a loud and uncompromising “yes”. “Most people look first at the benefits when they start a business, and hardly consider their social impact. I decided to make purpose the priority of my business, while caring about financial sustainability”. 

She also wanted to tackle the environmental issue by using renewable materials, but postponed the ambition considering what a challenge being socially fair already was in fashion industry. She notices the proliferation of initiatives such as hers in the sector - like [Fashion4Freedom](http://www.fashion4freedom.com) in Vietnam - but there is still a very long way to go before workers have decent work conditions in developing countries.
